Abstract
Solar Orbiter will orbit the Sun down to a distance of 0.22 AU allowing detailed in situ studies of important but unexplored regions of
the solar wind in combination with coordinated remote sensing of the Sun. In-situ measurements require high quality measurements of
particle distributions and electric and magnetic Ô¨Åelds. We show that such important scientiÔ¨Åc topics as the identiÔ¨Åcation of coronal heating remnants, solar wind turbulence, magnetic reconnection and shock formation within coronal mass ejections all require electric Ô¨Åeld
and plasma density measurements in the frequency range from DC up to about 100 Hz. We discuss how such measurements can be
achieved using the double-probe technique. We sketch a few possible antenna design solutions.

1. Introduction
Solar Orbiter is an ESA mission planned for launch
after 2015 that is going to produce images of the Sun at
an unprecedented resolution and simultaneously perform
the closest ever in situ measurements. This combination
will allow us to address many important science questions
as outlined in the Solar Orbiter science requirement document. Marsch et al. (2005) presents a short summary of the
main goals and the mission proÔ¨Åle of the Solar Orbiter. The
Solar Orbiter will have a 150-day orbit with the perihelion
at 0.22 AU  47 Rx  33 ¬∑ 106 m. At perihelion the orbital diÔ¨Äerential motion relative to the Sun becomes as low as
2.5/day allowing investigations of the temporal evolution
of solar phenomena both remotely and in situ. The orbit
is in 3:2 resonance with Venus and the inclination of the
orbit is increased at each Venus passage, and at the end
of the nominal mission the inclination will exceed 30.

Thus, the Solar Orbiter will cover a wide range of latitudes
allowing studies of diÔ¨Äerent solar phenomena.
The Solar Orbiter is planned to have two suites of
instruments, one for remote observations of the Sun and
another for in situ observations. Details are described in
the Solar Orbiter payload deÔ¨Ånition document. The
in situ instruments can be divided into two main packages:
the Field Package and the Particle Package. When selecting
speciÔ¨Åc instruments for the mission diÔ¨Äerent compromises
must be made regarding the design, the measurement
range, the resolution, the quality, etc. All these compromises and trade-oÔ¨Äs are weighted one against the other, based
on the scientiÔ¨Åc objectives, constraints of power, mass,
design, etc. In the case of the Fields Package, the major
compromises are related to the number, type, design and
location of antennas. Here we argue that many important
science questions require that the Fields Package can measure low-frequency electric Ô¨Åeld and density Ô¨Çuctuations.
By low-frequency here we mean DC up to 100 Hz, thus
covering MHD scales and frequencies up to characteristic
ion and ion/electron scales. Measurements of electric Ô¨Åeld

and density Ô¨Çuctuations at these frequencies is a very challenging task and so far heliosphere missions have not been
able to supply reliable data in this frequency range, see discussion in the Introduction section of Kellogg et al. (2006).
We believe that Solar Orbiter can be the Ô¨Årst such mission
that provides good quality electric Ô¨Åeld and density Ô¨Çuctuation measurements in this frequency range. This puts
some signiÔ¨Åcant constraints on the possible antenna design.
In the Science section we present a few examples of important science questions that require low-frequency electric
Ô¨Åeld and density Ô¨Çuctuation measurements. In the Context
section we discuss the available low-frequency electric Ô¨Åeld
and density measurements from other spacecraft missions
in past as well as upcoming missions. Particularly we stress
the advantages of carrying out such measurements by the
Solar Orbiter. In the Instrumentation section we suggest a
few possible technical solutions and discuss their advantages
and disadvantages. The results are summarized in Section 5.
2. Science
One of the top-level scientiÔ¨Åc goals of the Solar Orbiter
mission is to ‚Äò‚ÄòDetermine the properties, dynamics and
interactions of plasma, Ô¨Åelds and particles in the nearSun heliosphere‚Äô‚Äô (Solar Orbiter science requirements
document). Under this goal there are many more speciÔ¨Åc
questions, some examples of which we will address below.
However, we note directly the importance of obtaining
electric Ô¨Åeld (E) and density Ô¨Çuctuation (dn) measurements.
 Simultaneous measurements of magnetic Ô¨Åeld (B), E and
dn allow us to distinguish among the slow, fast, and
intermediate MHD wave modes which are of fundamental importance.
 Much of the local wave-particle interaction is due to
electrostatic waves that can be often observed only in
E and dn data.
 Many fundamental quantities such as Poynting Ô¨Çux and
wave energy require knowledge of B, E, and/or dn.
 Of particular interest are E and dn measurements at
MHD scales and scales covering characteristic ion scales
where MHD starts to break down as these are the scales
where ions can be energized.

2.1. Plasma parameters at the Solar Orbiter perihelion
Before discussing some of the scientiÔ¨Åc topics in more
details we characterize the plasma at perihelion of the Solar
Orbiter where most of the science operations will be carried
out. Typical plasma parameters that can be expected at
0.22 AU distance are given in Table 1. The wide range of
parameters gives a correspondingly wide range of characteristic scales that are involved in physical processes. Some
typical values of these scales are given in Table 2. As a
rough rule of thumb we can see that characteristic frequencies involving ions ‚Äì proton gyrofrequency fcp, lower

2.2. Solar wind turbulence
The understanding of physical processes that lead to
solar wind turbulence and its role in coronal heating and
solar wind acceleration are major topics in coronal studies
(Leamon et al., 2000 Bruno et al., 2006). As an example,
Cranmer (2004) states that ‚Äò‚ÄòMuch what has been done
until now is to work backwards, from the measured plasma
parameters deduce the properties of the kinetic-scale Ô¨Çuctuations that would provide the energy‚Äô‚Äô [for extended coronal heating]. They suggest that it is important to look at
large scale energy input to the turbulence as a constraint
on possible dissipation at smaller scales. At the same time
there is a large gap in our knowledge of the kinetic Ô¨Çuctuations, particularly at dissipation scales where the energy
from the turbulence leads to the dissipation in form of
coronal heating. Characteristic dissipation scales are comparable to ion scales, can be both spatial and temporal,
and from Table 2 we see that they correspond to frequencies from DC up to about 100 Hz. In situ measurements of
these kinetic Ô¨Çuctuation scales are crucial for the understanding of turbulence dissipation mechanisms.

Fig. 1. Density Ô¨Çuctuation spectra as estimated from radio sounding of
solar corona during the Galileo spacecraft solar conjunction EÔ¨Åmov et al.,
2005. The spectra show two spectral breakpoints where spectra Ô¨Çattens at
low and high frequencies. If we look at the high frequency spectral
breakpoint as measured at two diÔ¨Äerent distances, 6.3 and 9.0 Rx, one can
see that the spectral breakpoint moves to higher frequencies with
increasing distance from the Sun, from 0.2 to 0.3 Hz, respectively, when
comparing 6.3 and 9.0 Rx distances. The authors conclude that the high
frequency spectral breakpoint at which the density spectra Ô¨Çatten out
moves to higher frequencies with increasing distance from the Sun. To
measure both the low and high frequency breakpoints at 0.22 AU
distance, density Ô¨Çuctuations should be measured in the frequency range
0.001‚Äì10 Hz. Figure adopted from Fig. 2 in EÔ¨Åmov et al. (2005).

2.2.1. Density Ô¨Çuctuations
Density Ô¨Çuctuations in the solar wind have been studied
both in situ and remotely. Density Ô¨Çuctuations at very low
frequencies have been measured in situ by the Helios spacecraft (Marsch and Tu, 1990). Using the ion instrument and
studying the frequency range 6 ¬∑ 10 6 6 ¬∑ 10 3 Hz, it is
shown that turbulence intensity and development are different in slow and fast solar winds. Similar conclusions
have been reached looking at even higher frequency density
Ô¨Çuctuations (f < 0.6 Hz) as estimated using remote coronal
sounding experiments (EÔ¨Åmov et al., 2005). In addition,
those observations show spectral breakpoints where density Ô¨Çuctuation spectra Ô¨Çatten out at both low and high frequencies (in the frequency range 0.01‚Äì1 Hz). There is a
clear dependence of the frequency of spectral breakpoints
on the distance from the Sun. This dependence is illustrated
in Fig. 1. The spectral breakpoints are of particular interest
in the turbulence studies as they indicate a change in the
turbulence regime and their in situ observations would be
crucial to understanding the ways density Ô¨Çuctuations are
injected and dissipated in the solar wind. Fig. 1 suggests
that to cover both spectral breakpoints at the Solar Orbiter
distance density Ô¨Çuctuations should be measured at least in
the frequency range 0.001‚Äì10 Hz.
2.2.2. Electric and magnetic Ô¨Åeld Ô¨Çuctuations
Solar wind turbulence has mainly been studied in situ by
analyzing magnetic Ô¨Åeld Ô¨Çuctuations. A major question is
how this turbulence leads to heating of the corona. Two
major mechanisms that have been proposed are ion cyclo-

tron heating and spectral cascade. In both cases wave electric Ô¨Åelds seen in the frame of moving ions should have
signiÔ¨Åcant amplitude at the ion gyrofrequency. In the Ô¨Årst
case waves at the ion gyrofrequency energize the ions while
in the second case spectral cascade leads to the generation
of waves with ever smaller wavelengths while at some limit
eÔ¨Écient damping sets in. A breakpoint in the magnetic Ô¨Åeld
spectra has been used as an indicator when turbulence goes
into the dissipative regime. Detailed analysis of 33 turbulent spectra observed by the Wind spacecraft have shown
that the breakpoint is located somewhere between 0.05‚Äì
0.2 Hz which corresponds to 2‚Äì3 fcp or 0.5‚Äì0.7 VSW(c/
xpi) 1 (Leamon et al., 2000). The main conclusion from
this is that understanding of the turbulence dissipation is
not possible without having observations covering frequencies around the ion gyrofrequency and covering spatial
lengths comparable to the ion inertial lengths scales.
An important question is what kind of measurements
would allow us to distinguish which of several turbulence
models best describes the solar wind. A recent study by Bale
et al. (2005) shows that electric Ô¨Åeld data are crucial for this
task. Using Cluster spacecraft data, Bale et al. (2005)
obtained the Ô¨Årst detailed observations of a breakpoint in
spectra from solar wind turbulence using both electric Ô¨Åeld
and magnetic Ô¨Åeld data. Fig. 2 shows the resulting spectra.
By combined usage of E and B spectra, Bale et al. (2005)
could distinguish that at the breakpoint spacecraft were
observing wave modes of kinetic AlfveÃÅn type, thus supporting the idea of spectral cascade. This was a single measurement that requires further conÔ¨Årmation by spacecraft at
1 AU distance. A major question is if similar mechanisms
are operating close to the Sun where the turbulence can still
signiÔ¨Åcantly contribute to the extended heating of corona.
2.3. Interplanetary Coronal Mass Ejections (CME)
Interplanetary shocks driven by CMEs are a source of
Type II solar bursts. Understanding CMEs and Type II solar
bursts is important for being able to predict CMEs that are a
major cause of geomagnetic storms. Theoretically predicted
behaviour of emissions depends on shock parameters
(Knock et al., 2003). The exact generation mechanisms of
the electromagnetic radiation are not clear. Mechanisms
such as Langmuir wave interaction with ion acoustic waves
or Langmuir wave conversion at density gradients have been
suggested. In addition, the bursts can have complicated
internal structure suggesting that most probably diÔ¨Äerent
generation mechanisms can be at play in parallel. Shocks
involve fast changes in density, and localized electric Ô¨Åelds
on ion scales. Also ion acoustic waves are on ion scales. Thus,
high time resolution E, B and density Ô¨Çuctuation measurements are needed to study these phenomena.
2.4. Reconnection
Magnetic reconnection is one of the fundamental
processes that needs to be better understood to make

signiÔ¨Åcant progress in explaining energy conversion, transport and other processes in the solar atmosphere. It is
involved on all scales, starting from CMEs where it is
believed to be crucial for allowing CMEs to escape the
Sun and ending with the smallest scales where microreconnection can be one of the ways energy is dissipated in solar
wind turbulence.
Recently several studies have been presented analyzing
local magnetic reconnection events in the solar wind from
0.31 AU out to 5.4 AU distance (Gosling et al., 2005; Gosling et al., 2006b; Gosling et al., 2006a). Most of these
events were associated with narrow current sheets forming
behind CMEs, see Fig. 3. Similar remote observations of
reconnection have been made using SOHO spacecraft
observations at distances close to the Sun (Lin et al.,
2005). The SOHO observations show that narrow extended
current sheets form behind the CMEs and reconnection is
ongoing within those current sheets starting a few solar
radii from the Sun. The Solar Orbiter would be optimally
located to observe the temporal evolution of the reconnection processes within these current sheets. The reconnection process can be identiÔ¨Åed using only particle
instruments, however, E Ô¨Åeld measurements are needed
for understanding the reconnection process as is well
known from the studies in the terrestrial magnetosphere
(Vaivads et al., 2006). For example, to understand how

diÔ¨Äerent particle species are energized during the reconnection process, one needs to have information on Ô¨Åelds on
characteristic scales of those particles, particularly E
because particles are energized by the E Ô¨Åeld. Also when
slow shocks or other discontinuities are involved one needs
to have E measurements to be able to estimate potential
jumps across the discontinuities.

3. The Solar Orbiter in the context of other missions
Several satellites have performed plasma measurements
in the solar wind. However, few missions with comprehensive plasma instrumentation have been dedicated for solar
and/or solar wind science and have had instruments to
measure electric Ô¨Åeld and/or density Ô¨Çuctuations in the frequency range from DC to about 100 Hz. Notable exceptions include Ulysses and Wind.
Ulysses was launched in 1990 on a trajectory toward
Jupiter, whose gravity was used to put the spacecraft in a
polar orbit around the Sun. To date the Sun has been circled twice. Ulysses included a 72-m tip-to-tip dipole antenna and a 7.5 m spin-axis monopole for electric Ô¨Åeld
measurements. In addition the spacecraft carried a Ô¨Çuxgate magnetometer. Both the electric Ô¨Åeld and the magnetic
Ô¨Åeld signals were fed into a Wave Form Analyzer that

performed spectral analysis in the range 0.08‚Äì448 Hz, in
addition to measurements at higher frequencies.
Wind was launched in 1994 and has spent most of its
time since launch in the near-Earth solar wind. Wind measures the electric Ô¨Åeld using two pairs of wire dipole antennas in the spin plane and one pair of rigid antennas along
the spin axis. A low-frequency FFT receiver covers the frequency range DC ‚Äì 10 kHz. There are also higher frequency receivers.
In addition to spacecraft dedicated to solar wind studies,
there have been many spacecraft that have had the terrestrial magnetosphere as the primary objective, but the
instrumentation of which have allowed detailed studies of
electric Ô¨Åeld and density Ô¨Çuctuations in the solar wind.
Examples are Cluster, Geotail, Polar, etc. Particularly the
multi-spacecraft capabilities of Cluster have proven very
valuable as shown by the turbulence example in the previous section.
Measurements of electric Ô¨Åeld and density Ô¨Çuctuations
in solar wind at distances less than 1 AU are lacking. While
Helios spacecraft had a possibility to measure electric Ô¨Åeld
spectra at low frequencies, the data under 500 Hz were
unusable due to the interference from the spacecraft solar
array (Schwenn and Marsch, 1991). In principle, spacecraft
bound for Venus should be usable for exploring the solar

wind in the inner heliosphere. However, from a plasma
point of view these spacecraft are usually not very well
instrumented.
Among future solar missions, Stereo (launch 2006) and
Solar Wind Sentinels (AO 2006) are the ones planned to
carry the most comprehensive plasma instrumentation. Stereo is focused on solar radio bursts. It does have the capability to measure waves also at lower frequencies, but the
extent to which this will be pursued is unclear. Solar Wind
Sentinels is a comprehensive multi-spacecraft mission to Ô¨Çy
inside of Earth‚Äôs orbit, focusing on providing some capability of space weather predictions.
BepiColombo will have a comprehensive plasma payload including low-frequency wave measurements. The
spacecraft will only spend part of its orbit around Mercury
in the solar wind and thus will not oÔ¨Äer the opportunity of
continuous monitoring of solar wave emissions in the lowfrequency domain. However, assuming the two missions
coincide in time, BepiColombo may be a nice complement
to Solar Orbiter, oÔ¨Ä and on providing a vantage point at a
diÔ¨Äerent heliospheric longitude.
Past and planned missions taken into account, Solar
Orbiter will provide a unique opportunity for continuous
in situ measurements of low-frequency wave activity in
the solar wind, at solar distances where the observed waves
may be remnants of the coronal heating processes. Furthermore, Solar Orbiter will at times co-rotate with the solar
surface. Finally, in addition to the plasma measurements,
Solar Orbiter will perform optical measurements in a wide
range of wavelengths, thus providing context for the interpretation of the wave measurements regardless of the
spacecraft‚Äôs location relative to Earth and terrestrial solar
observatories.
4. Instrumentation
As demonstrated in the previous Sections, information
on electric Ô¨Åeld and plasma density Ô¨Çuctuations at high
time resolution is needed for proper understanding of
important dynamical processes in the corona and solar
wind. To obtain such measurements, we here propose a
double-probe instrument, with electronics for the measurement of electric Ô¨Åelds from DC up to 1 kHz and sharing
antennas with an instrument measuring waves at higher
frequencies. As a by-product, such an instrument also gives
information on plasma density Ô¨Çuctuations at high time
resolution, by use of the spacecraft potential. Additional
plasma diagnostics could also be obtained from use in
Langmuir probe mode.
Double-probe instruments are widely used for measurement of electric Ô¨Åelds in the terrestrial environment. In
denser ionospheric plasmas, the probe potential is often
Ô¨Çoating (Maynard, 1998), while instruments operating in
the tenuous plasmas in the magnetosphere and solar wind
typically use a technique based on sending a Ô¨Åxed bias current to the probes (Pedersen et al., 1998). To minimize perturbations from the spacecraft carrying the instrument, one

A. Vaivads et al. / Advances in Space Research 39 (2007) 1502‚Äì1509

usually measures the voltage between two identical probes
mounted at the tips of long booms protruding from the
spacecraft. In the ideal case, the boom length should exceed
the Debye length, to ensure small inÔ¨Çuence of any electrical
perturbations from the spacecraft. In practice, useful measurements can be obtained also in more tenuous plasmas,
for reasonably symmetric spacecraft and a carefully
designed electrical neighbourhood of the probes. The latter
neighbourhood usually consists of elements bootstrapped
to the probe potential plus or minus some oÔ¨Äset value,
ensuring that the potential at the probe is not just determined by the boom potential.
To optimize the use of scarce spacecraft resources, it is
likely desirable to use the same booms for LF and HF measurements. This can be achieved in several ways. One way
is to use the LF probes also as monopole antenna elements
for the HF instrument, as is very successfully done on for
example the Cluster satellites (Gustafsson et al., 1997; Gurnett et al., 1997). However, the frequency range that can be
achieved in this way without having preampliÔ¨Åers located
on the boom, close to the probes, is likely insuÔ¨Écient for
an HF instrument. Another way is to use the outer shield
of the booms themselves as antennas for the HF instru-

1507

ment, while the probes are mounted on the tip of the
booms (or actually constituted by the boom tips, see
below).
For solar wind measurements, booms much in excess of
the Debye length (5‚Äì10 m, see Table 2) can be achieved
only as wire booms on spinning spacecraft. However, solid
booms with lengths of order 5 m are certainly feasible, and
given a reasonably symmetric spacecraft with a conductive
surface and a careful design of probe and adjacent biased
parts, good electric Ô¨Åeld measurements can be obtained
with such booms. In order to investigate polarization properties of waves and obtain a reasonably complete picture of
the electric Ô¨Åeld, measurements in two dimensions are
needed. This means a minimum of three booms, which
could be arranged as suggested in Fig. 4a. From the diÔ¨Äerences between two pairs of probes, for example 1‚Äì2 and
1‚Äì3, a 2-D E-Ô¨Åeld can be constructed. However, a more
symmetric arrangement would be obtained using four
booms as illustrated in Fig. 4b. This also brings all probes
away from any wake and Mach cone structures forming
around the spacecraft. The higher degree of symmetry
and longer baseline as compared to Fig. 4a should also
oÔ¨Äer advantages for an HF instrument, though at the cost

of the loss of the possibility of obtaining three-dimensional
measurements using each boom as a monopole antenna
oÔ¨Äered by the arrangement in Fig. 4a. The 3D capability
is restored using the conÔ¨Åguration Fig. 4c, with one boom
pair angled towards the Sun at around 45. Other possibilities may also be considered, and the Ô¨Ånal choice of boom
conÔ¨Åguration will need to take into consideration how to
minimize inÔ¨Çuence of wake eÔ¨Äects, asymmetries and spacecraft photoelectrons on the LF measurements under the
constraints posed by the needs of the HF instrumentation
and the spacecraft resource budget.
On a non-spinning spacecraft with a well deÔ¨Åned symmetry direction for photoemission caused by UV radiation
as well as for plasma Ô¨Çow, as both come from the Sun,
cylindrical probes could be used. This amounts to using
the outermost part of the boom as a probe. Depending
on boom thickness, a probe length of 10‚Äì20 cm could be
considered, with some adjacent biased (bootstrapped) elements. Probe arrangements of this kind, including the
cylindrical geometry, will be used on the EFI instrument
on the upcoming THEMIS mission, and are planned also
for the MMS FIELDS instrument. The EFI instrument
on the POLAR satellite (Harvey et al., 1995) has stiÔ¨Ä axial
booms of similar size, but uses spherical probes, which
would be an unnecessary mechanical complication in our
case. Nevertheless, the axial booms of POLAR EFI are a
close analogue of one pair of booms in Fig. 4b.
5. Conclusions
Solar Orbiter is an ESA mission planned to take high
resolution images of the Sun and perform the closest ever
in situ observations of solar wind. Several major scientiÔ¨Åc
questions can be addressed by observing electric Ô¨Åeld and
density Ô¨Çuctuations from low frequencies up to around
100 Hz. This frequency range includes waves essential for
wave-particle interaction involving ions (the ion gyrofrequency and the lower hybrid frequency) and also ion scales
(the ion gyroradius) Doppler shifted by the solar wind
motion as seen in the spacecraft frame.
One important question is what models best describe
the Ô¨Çuctuations on ion temporal and spatial scales in
the solar wind, and how these Ô¨Çuctuations are dissipated
to heat ions and electrons. Clearly observations of density
and electric Ô¨Åeld Ô¨Çuctuations are needed, together with
measurements of the magnetic Ô¨Åeld at the same frequencies, to obtain scientiÔ¨Åc closure. Another example is the
generation of electromagnetic waves such as Type II solar
bursts from interplanetary shocks. These waves are interesting since they can be used for remote sensing once their
generation is understood. This generation most likely
involves rapid density variations and localized electric
Ô¨Åeld which can be detected in situ by Solar Orbiter. Magnetic reconnection is a phenomenon believed to be important for the escape of CMEs, and at much smaller scales
may be important for local energy dissipation. As is
known from studies in the terrestrial magnetosphere,

observations of small scale density and electric Ô¨Åeld structures are essential for understanding reconnection in a
new parameter regime.
As any exploratory spacecraft, Solar Orbiter will have
limited resources for the payload. To optimize the use of
resources, one must seriously consider using the same
antennas over the whole frequency range of interest. We
Ô¨Ånd that by using reasonable compromises it is possible
to use the same payload to detect small scale and low-frequency density and electric Ô¨Åeld Ô¨Çuctuations, and to
observe electric Ô¨Åelds at frequencies of several MHz.

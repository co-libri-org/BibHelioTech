1. - Introduction The interaction of the solar wind with the exosphere and ionosphere of Venus has given rise to the creation of a so-called induced magnetosphere (see e.g., ; ; ; ; ). Mass-loading of the solar wind through the ionisation of exospheric neutrals slows it down and leads to the creation of a bow shock; behind it, the super-magnetosonic solar wind is braked to sub-magnetosonic speeds. The interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) is convected towards the planet and magnetic flux builds up on the sub-solar side (e.g., ). Further away from the planet, the IMF is transported by the solar wind velocity and gets draped around the planet leading to the creation of an induced magnetosphere (see e.g., ). Downstream from the planet, a magnetotail is created, which consists of two lobes with oppositely directed magnetic fields, separated by a current sheet (e.g., ). Between these two lobes of stretched-out magnetic field and the bow shock exists the magnetosheath, where the slowed-down plasma gets accelerated back again to the pre-shocked solar wind velocity. However, as Venus has no intrinsic magnetic field ( ; ; ), the normal to the current sheet is only dependent on the upstream IMF direction as a consequence of field line draping, rather than having a preferred direction in a planet based inertial frame. Just as in the case of the Earth’s magnetotail, this structure shows a wide range of activity, with: magnetic reconnection having been observed ( , ; ) as well as magnetotail flapping ( ; ). There is also a difference between the turbulent wave power in the magnetosheath compared to the lobes ( ; ). The first flythrough of Venus’s magnetotail was done by Mariner 10 ( ), from as far downstream as ∼100 R V (1 R V ≈ 6, 051.8 km, Venus radius). Other previous investigations of the magnetotail of Venus have been performed mainly using data from the Pioneer Venus Orbiter and Venus Express, However, their limited apoapsis meant that they were not able to study Venus’s magnetotail region further downstream than ∼11 R V . This means that there is still much to learn about the structure and behaviour of the magnetotail at further distances downstream of Venus. Questions such as how far the Venusian tail is extended downstream of the planet, how prone it is to magnetic reconnection events and at which locations, and to what extent it is influenced by the solar wind remain open. Recently, several new missions have been launched, using Venus for gravity assists in order to reach their final orbit or goal. We consider whether these mission provide the opportunity to gain further insights into the dynamics of the Venusian magetosphere. The Parker Solar Probe ( ) has a total of seven Venus flybys to adjust the spacecraft’s orbit for closer perihelia during solar encounters. Two flybys on 3 October 2018 and 26 December 2019, approaching Venus from downstream, showed strong kinetic-scale turbulence in the magnetosheath ( ), sub-proton scale magnetic holes ( ), and double layers near the bow shock ( ). BepiColombo, ESA’s mission to Mercury ( ; ), has used two Venus flybys in order to brake enough to reach and insert the spacecraft into orbit around the innermost planet. The first flyby took place on 15 October 2020, approaching Venus from the upstream direction and leaving the neighbourhood of the planet via a long passage through the magnetotail. During this flyby, evidence was found of draping in the magnetosheath in the direction perpendicular to the Venus-Sun line ( ), by field lines hanging up at Venus’s pile-up boundary on one side and being connected to the solar wind at the other, confirming previous finding with Venus Express ( ). Further down the tail, near the centre, close to the central plasma sheet-current sheet, flapping was observed. The second flyby will occur on 11 August 2021, only two days after Solar Orbiter carries out its second Venus flyby. Solar Orbiter ( , ), the mission that is the focus of this paper, will have a total of seven Venus gravity assist manoeuvres to end up in a highly inclined orbit, at ∼33.4°, around the Sun with a 2:3-resonance with Venus’s orbit after the seventh flyby in June 2029. The second Venus flyby will be in August 2021, two days before BepiColombo will have its second flyby of Venus. The third flyby will be in the third quarter of 2022. 2. - Data We use the Solar Orbiter high-resolution (8 Hz, normal mode) magnetometer data ( ) of the first Venus flyby on 27 December 2020 to study the induced magnetosphere and the plasma wave activity around Venus. The spacecraft approached the planet from downstream, through the induced magnetotail and left the induced magnetosphere over Venus’s north pole before finally passing through the bow shock. The closest approach to the planet was at ∼2.26 R V from the centre of the planet at ∼12:40 UT. The flyby geometry is shown in Fig. , where also the location of different activity in the induced magnetotail is colour-coded, as well as the locations where the spacecraft is suspected to be in the magnetosheath. We used the bow shock and ionopause model from and the upper mantle boundary model (see also, , for a correction). The data are shown in Fig. in the Venus Solar Orbital (VSO) coordinate system, where X VSO is along the Venus-Sun line, Y VSO is in the opposite direction of Venus’s orbital velocity, and Z VSO completes the triad, in the direction of Venus’s rotational axis. Also, the same colour-coding as in Fig. is used here. Unless otherwise specified, the data are in VSO coordinates. Figure shows a 3D rendering of the magnetic field along the orbit of Solar Orbiter. To support the magnetometer data, we also used the measurements from the Energetic Particle Detector – SupraThermal Electrons and Protons instrument ( EPD-STEP ), showing energetic ions as well as Radio and Plasma Waves  ( RPW ) observations of the electron density determined from from quasi-thermal noise (QTN; i.e. the plasma frequency) and the SpaceCraft Potential (SCP; ; ). 3. - Large structure of induced magnetosphere In order to study the large-scale structure of the induced magnetosphere, the data are low-pass filtered, with a cut-off frequency of 1/300 Hz (5 min); the cone ( θ c ) and clock ( ϕ c ) angles of the magnetic field are calculated as follows: _placeholder_formula_ _placeholder_formula_ A cone angle of θ c = 0° (180° ) implies a sunward (anti-sunward) directed B -field and θ c = 90° a field directed perpendicular to the Venus-Sun line. The clock angle ϕ c is the direction in the YZ VSO -plane with ϕ c = 0° indicating an eastward pointing field and ϕ c = 90° a northward one. The result is shown in Fig. . First of all, we observe that the cone angle in the solar wind in the interval between 10:30–15:00 UT, θ c, SW ≈ 120°, namely, anti-sunward, a direction which is also seen in the downstream region of Venus, up to ∼08:00 UT, when the spacecraft was ∼33 R V away from the planet. The nominal Parker spiral angle at Venus is θ P ≈ 36° /144°, so the field is slightly less radial than nominal. The downstream regions where the cone angle is almost the same as the upstream solar wind cone angle are shaded in blue in Figs. and . After ∼08:00 UT, θ c increases to ∼160°, indicating a more draped and tail-like, magnetic field, that is, the field is in more aligned with the Venus-Sun line as compared to the solar wind. This is the case up until ∼09:10 UT when the field turns back to the background, solar wind state. At ∼10:45 UT the field turns sunward at θ c ≈ 60° until ∼11:30 UT, which is the solar wind direction with the oppositely directed field. At a distance of ∼8.5 R V , at ∼11:30 UT, Solar Orbiter enters the region that is most influenced by the interaction of the solar wind with Venus. The magnetic field magnitude starts to increase, which is also seen in all three components. There is an interesting structure in both B y and B z at ∼12:20 UT, showing a strong rotation in the field, with B y changing sign. Overall, the clock angle remains near ϕ c ≈ 20° (eastward) until ∼09:10 UT, where it increases to ϕ c ≈ 60° (more northward), then slowly decreases again to the solar wind value ϕ c ≈ 20°; this is valid except for the B x − B z structure, where the clock angle increases to ϕ c ≈ 70° (westward). Before discussing these structures in more detail, we present some observations of the upstream solar wind for context. As can be seen in Fig. in the last blue box, upstream of the bow shock, the average magnetic field vector is B ≈ [ − 5, 6, 3] nT. This field direction has consequences for the draping of the magnetic field around the planet, such that the symmetry plane for the draped field (and thus the induced tail) is tilted in the Y − Z -plane by ∼15 − 30° (see the clock angle ϕ c ). Marked structures (st1 through st4, discussed below) have been identified by eye using the low-pass filtered magnetic field data and the cone and clock angle. They also stand out by their strong variations in magnetic field strength. Combining the presence of these structures, which are mainly typical structures found in the magnetotail proper, being outside of where the field has the solar wind cone angle, is an indication that the blue boxes demonstrate when the spacecraft is in the magnetosheath. 3.1. - Marked structures Marked magnetic structures are highlighted in red in Fig. and studied below. We performed a minimum variance analysis (MVA, ) on the data and transformed them to MVA coordinates. The results of the MVA analysis for each red-shaded interval are shown in Table . 3.1.1. - st1: flux tube The first magnetic structure, st1, at ∼04:40 UT and ∼(−55, −6,−6) R V shows a slightly decreasing field magnitude, B m = 10 → 7 nT, and a strong rotation in B max = 7 → −6 → 3 nT. This may be consistent with the passage of a plasmoid/flux rope. The minimum variance direction, given in Table shows that the axis is significantly tilted with respect to the tail axis. Figure shows a zoom-in on this interval, with the magnetic field data in both VSO and MVA coordinates. Interestingly, there seem to be three jumps in the electron density as measured from the spacecraft potential, indicated by the vertical dotted lines. The resolution of the QTN data is not high enough to capture this structure in the density, but overall, the two datasets agree quite nicely. These are close to where B z changes signs (first and last) and B z reaches a minimum negative value. However, the electron density increases throughout this structure, as can also be seen in Fig. . 3.1.2. - st2: reconnection site The second structure, st2, displayed in the zoom-in in Fig. , at ∼09:34 UT and ∼(−21, −3, −1) R V shows a strong decrease in the magnitude of the field B m = 4.5 → 0.7 nT, which might be indicative of Solar Orbiter crossing a magnetic reconnection site (see e.g., , ). Looking again in VSO coordinates, we find that B x remains negative and both B y and B z change signs. In MVA coordinates we clearly see how the maximum variance component change sign, with the other two components decreasing slightly near the minimum in B m . The EPD/STEP data in the bottom panel show a population of ions at ≲7 keV before the crossing. After the crossing there are significantly less counts. The viewing direction of EPD/STEP is roughly sunward, which is consistent with the observation of energised ions before crossing the reconnection site, where the ions are tailward accelerated towards the instrument aperture. The electron density from the spacecraft potential shows clearly two different regions on either side of the reconnection site. The Venus-ward side of the reconnection site shows an increase of Δ N e ≈ 10 cm −3 , which decreases again later at ∼09:38 UT, when B max reverses sign again. The spacecraft most likely exits the region of reconnected field lines at this point, with all three magnetic field components returning to their pre-event values. The two peaks in the STEP spectrogram around ∼09:28 UT can be related to Solar Orbiter crossing the separatrix, along which accelerated ions are travelling towards the detector. 3.1.3. - st3: tearing instablility Structure st3, displayed in the zoom-in in Fig. , around ∼10:30 UT and ∼(−15, −2, 0) R V shows an interesting behaviour. Around the first black dotted line there are three depressions in B x where the cone angle θ c → 90°. During the steady decrease of B x over these three depressions, B z increases slightly, whereas B y remains constant. With the very steep θ c , this is reminiscent of magnetotail dipolarisations in the Earth’s magnetotail, with little variation in the total magnetic field strength B m (see e.g., ). After the last dipolarisation, the first grey dotted line, the magnetic field strength starts to increase through an increase in B x and B z combined with a slightly decreasing B y . This leads to a rotation of the clock-angle back to a more tail-like value, ϕ c ≈ 120°. The field remains relatively stable until the second grey dotted line, where B x again decreases, with a slight increase in B y , and the cone angle decreases again to θ c ≈ 97°. Towards the end of the structure, the cone angle changes from θ c ≈ 120° to ∼60°, namely, in the complementary direction. The (near) cross-tail direction of the magnetic field, θ c ≈ 90°, may be an indication that the spacecraft is passing through the neighbourhood of possible reconnection sites, where closed field lines might exist. The first and second grey dotted lines, with both near-northward field indicate that this might be a region of ‘closed field lines’. The EPD-STEP data in panel (E) show that between these two lines, the energetic ions disappear, except for a burst at the grey-shaded area, which occurs when B y changes sign and there is a small decrease in B m . The electron density increases strongly after the last dipolarisation, and decreases towards the grey-shaded area (back to almost pre-event value) and then decreases further. This indicates that there are two regions inside this structure, separated by the burst in the EPD-STEP data and B y changing sign. The whole structure, bounded by two dipolarised field regions, can be explained with a tearing instability (see e.g., ) acting in Venus’s magnetotail, creating two or more X -lines with O -lines in between. Because of the sign-change of B y , the differences in the electron density and the strong burst in EPD-STEP it could be argued that Solar Orbiter is passing by a separatrix, moving from one magnetic island to another, without actually seeing the X -line in between. 3.1.4. - st4: over-draping The last structure, st4, displayed as a zoom-in in Fig. , is just downstream of Venus right before crossing the bow shock, where there is a strong rotation in the magnetic field, mainly in B y but also evident in B z , see Fig. . Apart from the gradual decrease behind the bow shock, the magnitude of the magnetic field does not change, indicating it is a true rotation of the field. At the boundaries of this rotation, there are small decreases in B m , created by the currents facilitating the rotation of the field. This structure is reminiscent of an ‘over-draping’ of the field (see e.g., ; ; ). The magnetic field in the magnetosheath is influenced by the ionospheric magnetic field, induced by ionospheric currents, and as a result, the field lines wrap around the planet. This effect can be so strong that the field drapes too far around Venus, such that the B y and B z components change signs (or in this case B z → 0). 3.2. - Bow shock The bow shock crossing occurs around ∼12:40 UT at ∼(0.02, −0.43, 2.22) R V from the centre of the planet. Figure shows a zoom-in on this interval, with the magnetic field data in VSO (top) and MVA (bottom) coordinates. Because of the large magnetic fluctuations on the bow shock ramp, the MVA is not well determined, as can be seen in Table , with λ min ∼ λ int ≪ λ max . The shock normal direction would result in an angle between normal and upstream magnetic field of ∠( B , n MVA )≈68°. A better estimate for the normal may be obtained by the magnetic coplanarity method given by ( ): _placeholder_formula_ _placeholder_formula_ where B d and B u are the downstream (12:39:40–12:39:46 UT) and upstream (12:39:54–12:40:00 UT) magnetic field vectors, respectively. This results in a normal direction n mc = ±(0.48, 0.61, −0.63), which results in an angle between normal and upstream magnetic field of ∠( B , n mc )≈88°, indicating a quasi-perpendicular bow shock. There are strong oscillations on the ramp of the bow shock, which are elliptically right-hand polarised in the ( B max , B int )-plane. The middle panel of Fig. shows that the electron density variation is in phase with the magnetic field strength variation, consistent with fast-mode and magnetosonic type oscillations (see e.g., ; ). 4. - High-frequency magnetic fluctuations The interaction of the solar wind with Venus’s exosphere and ionosphere gives rise to large-scale MHD phenomena as discussed above, and also micro-scale and kinetic effects such as ion pick-up and acceleration. High-frequency, in this context, should be interpreted as waves with frequencies up to ten times the proton gyro frequency. Venus has been shown to have a large hydrogen exosphere that expands well beyond the bow shock ( ). Photo-ionisation of the neutral hydrogen atoms leads to proton pick-up in the solar wind. These new ions create a ring-beam distribution which is prone to the growth of two unstable modes: the ion cyclotron (IC) and the mirror mode (MM) instabilities ( ). Which of the two instabilities will grow is dependent on the plasma- β (the ratio between plasma and magnetic pressure). For small β , for instance, in the solar wind, the IC instability dominates ( ; ; ; , ), whereas for high β , for instance, behind the bow shock, the MM instability plays a major role ( , , ; ; ). 4.1. - Ion cyclotron waves Local ion pick-up in the solar wind creates a ring-beam distribution, which may generate IC waves that will be observed as left-hand polarised waves below the local cyclotron frequency in the spacecraft frame through the anomalous Doppler shift (see e.g., the discussions in ; ). However, ‘elsewhere’, non-locally generated IC waves, subsequently transported by the solar wind, will be observed as Doppler-shifted waves, and may, thereby, change handedness (e.g., ). In order to study these waves, the magnetic field data are transformed to a mean-field aligned (MFA) coordinate system, where Z MFA is along the low-pass filtered magnetic field and X MFA and Y MFA are combined into a right- and left-handed coordinate: _placeholder_formula_ _placeholder_formula_ A dynamical spectrum is produced by calculating the power spectral density (PSD) in overlapping windows of 1024 points (128 s) shifted over 64 points (8 s). The result for the compressional ( C , which is the Z MFA -component) and left- and right-hand polarised fields are shown in Fig. . The local proton cyclotron frequency is shown by the thin white line in each panel. 4.1.1. - Magnetosheath In all three dynamic spectra of the C , R , and L components there is broad-band power below f cp . However, the L component shows enhanced spectral power above f cp compared to R and C . In order to further investigate the ratio between the PSD of both components D = L / R is calculated, which is shown in the bottom panel of Fig. . There are patches with strong left-hand polarised wave power. The frequency variation of these signatures is highly correlated with f cp , but shifted to higher frequencies, which is consistent with the presence of Doppler-shifted IC waves. Assuming the IC waves propagate with the Alfvén velocity, v A ≈ 30 km s −1 (for B m = 8 nT and n = 40 cm −3 ) and the plasma flow velocity in the magnetosheath is solar wind-like ( V SW ≈ 320 km s −1 ), we estimate a Doppler-shift in frequency by a factor of ∼10. The red line in the bottom panel of Fig. shows 10 f cp , which seems to be the upper boundary of the patches up to ∼10:00 UT, but is at higher frequencies than the peak of the wave power. The thick white line shows 6 f cp , which seems to match the maxima rather well. Using this assumption of Doppler-shifted cyclotron waves, an estimate can be made of the plasma flow velocity by inverting the Doppler shift equation, which then leads to v MS ≈ 180 km s −1 . This would mean that the plasma in the magnetosheath has not yet been accelerated to solar wind speeds, even as far down the tail as ∼55 R V . Close to Venus, between 10:00 and 13:00 UT, the strongest power lies at much lower frequencies than the red line, indicating a smaller Doppler shift, with the plasma flow velocity in the magnetosheath not yet accelerated up to V SW . It should be noted that most of the strong left-hand power is occurring within the regions marked as having θ c ≈ θ c, SW (thus in the magnetosheath) and, interestingly, also at the location where the cone angle θ c ≈ 160° (and thus in the tail proper) between ∼08:20 and ∼08:45 UT, after which there is a sudden decrease in the power in all components (Table ). 4.1.2. - Around the bow shock The dynamic spectra of the magnetic field around the bow shock crossing can be seen in Fig. . Just downstream from the bow shock, there is a strong left-handed signature visible close to the local proton gyro frequency. Following this structure with the plasma flow, moving further into the magnetosheath (i.e. going back in time) the signature follows the proton cyclotron line, up to ∼12 : 30 UT, after which it starts to deviate. The observed frequency increases from ∼ f cp to ∼3 f cp . This can be interpreted as locally produced IC waves by pick-up inside the bow shock, which are then Doppler shifted by the acceleration of the magnetosheath plasma flow (see, e.g., ; ). In the solar wind, upstream of Venus’s bow shock, strong proton cyclotron wave power is expected, as was shown by , , . Interestingly, in Fig. there is little evidence for proton cyclotron waves in the upstream region. These waves are usually between 0.8 and 1 f c, p (the white and cyan lines in the bottom panel). There are a few small enhancements in left-handed power at ∼13:00, ∼13:25 UT between the white and cyan line, which are interpreted as proton cyclotron waves and at ∼13:29 UT below the cyan line, which might not, most likely, be associated with proton cyclotron waves. Ion cyclotron waves just downstream of the quasi-perpendicular bow shock were also observed at Earth, for which the upstream plasma- β < 0.5 ( ); namely, a ‘low- β ’ shock. It was also shown that behind the bow shock the MM instability criterion was not at all, or only marginally, fulfilled. We estimate the solar wind plasma- β with B SW = 8 nT, N SW = 20 cm −3 and use a typical value of T i, SW = 13 eV ( ): _placeholder_formula_ In order to determine the plasma- β behind the bow shock the Rankine-Hugoniot relations (see, e.g., ) are solved, with the numbers above as upstream input parameters, the average IMF magnetic field given in Sect. and the bow shock normal calculated with Eq. ( ). This results in β MS ≈ 1.3. shows that in the magnetosheath the temperature asymmetry T ⊥ / T ∥ must be ∼15% larger for mirror mode generation than for ion cyclotron wave generation for β MS ≈ 1.3 to achieve the same growth rate. 4.2. - Mirror modes and magnetic holes MMs are often driven in high- β plasmas with a temperature anisotropy T ⊥ > T ∥ ( ). The instability criterion for a bi-Maxwellian distribution is ( ): _placeholder_formula_ where _placeholder_formula_ At Venus, and other planets, these structures are often observed behind the quasi-perpendicular bow shock, where the ions are heated mainly in the perpendicular to B ( , , ). MMs consist of trains of magnetic field depressions combined with plasma density enhancements, balancing the total pressure. In the absence of adequate thermal plasma measurements, one can still identify these structures using magnetic field data only, as proposed by , , and later confirmed with plasma data by . The ‘Lucek’ method involves a MVA analysis within sliding windows of 10 s with a shift of 1 s obtaining the minimum variance n min and maximum variance n max directions, and determining a background magnetic field, B bk by low-pass filtering the data for periods longer than 0.5 min. MMs are characterised by two angles: _placeholder_formula_ _placeholder_formula_ where the 20° derives from numerical simulations of MMs by , who actually find a maximum angle of 30°. Also, a limit is set to the ‘depth’ of the MM defined as: _placeholder_formula_ With these conditions the blue-shaded areas in Fig. are identified as candidate MMs, although it can be argued that by reducing the Δ| B |/| B | slightly, more structures that can be identified by eye as possible MMs are also found. However, it must be noted that the depth of the MMs is similar to that found by . However, taking into account that we have on hand an estimate of the electron density at sufficient resolution, another conclusion about these compressional magnetic field variations ought to be drawn. In contrast to true MMs, the magnetic field variation Δ B / B and the density variations Δ N / N are in phase. Therefore, these fluctuations may also be fast-mode or magnetosonic oscillations (see e.g., ). Based on the conclusions in Sect. , namely, that there is strong IC wave activity behind the bow shock, the lack of MMs might not be particularly surprising. We argue that the plasma- β and the temperature asymmetry behind the bow shock favour the growth of IC waves instead of MMs. However, the presence of MMs or magnetic holes (MHs) can be seen in the data further away from the bow shock, where those structures have had time to grow. Figure shows an interval between 11:30:20 and 11:30:30 UT where the conditions in Eqs. ( )–( ) are satisfied and the magnetic field and density fluctuations are in anti-phase. Similarly, the interval 11:31:00–11:31:10 UT is also consistent with the presence of MMs or MHs. Here, the spacecraft is already at X VSO ≈ −8 R V , far downstream of the bow shock. 5. - Comparison with earlier missions On 5 February 1974, Mariner 10, on its way to Mercury, flew along the length of Venus’s magnetotail (wake), in an orbit in the X R -plane similar to Solar Orbiter, however differing strongly in the Y - and Z -components. studied the magnetic field data starting at a distance of ∼100 R V from the planet. No evidence was found for a bow shock crossing entering the far tail. The authors did not observe a typical magnetotail structure (as compared to Earth). They found that, when the magnetic field direction and the spacecraft velocity vector aligned, the direction was not predominantly along X VSO . The data were categorised into three bins, quiet, disturbed, and mixed. It was found that the longitudinal (cylindrical) component of the field rotated clockwise, when the spacecraft crossed from a quiet to a disturbed region. This was interpreted as Mariner 10 entering into planetary tail field. This planetery field, however, had a significant Y -component for most crossings. The upstream conditions of the IMF are F = 20 γ , ϕ ≈ 360°, and θ ≈ 0° ( ), indicating a mostly radial magnetic field. These crossings are reminiscent of the crossings by Solar Orbiter discussed above, where the spacecraft moves from the magnetosheath to the tail proper. There does not seem to be a similar variation in quiet or disturbed field in the Solar Orbiter data, where _placeholder_formula_ nT and rms _placeholder_formula_ for the ‘magnetosheath-quiet’ (‘magnetotail-disturbed’) intervals. On its way to Jupiter, the Galileo spacecraft used a Venus gravitational assist, where the orbit skimmed the bow shock (see e.g., ). The magnetometer data were used to study the cross section of the far bow shock, which seemed to be smaller when it was aligned with the IMF direction compared to when it was perpendicular to the IMF. Venus’s near-tail region, at | X |≲12 R V , was studied by using Pioneer Venus data. Studying 12 passes through the central induced magnetotail (in the period 1981–1983) along Pioneer Venus’s polar orbit, the authors found that the spacecraft was crossing the central current sheet multiple times during each crossing. From their figures, the quasi-period of the crossings is ≲10 min. The spacecraft moved from clearly defined, oppositely directed lobe fields and whether or not this can be considered magnetotail flapping is not addressed. The main difference between the orbits studied by and the Solar Orbiter Venus 1 flyby is the IMF direction and thereby the morphology of the induced magnetotail. For the Pioneer Venus orbits, the central current sheet was almost in the X − Z -plane due to mainly B y -dominated IMF; whereas for Solar Orbiter, the IMF also had a considerable B z component, tilting the central plasma sheet away from the X − Z -plane. In our approach, the magnetic field latitude, ϕ the cone-angle, θ c were used for region identification, similarly to , as shown above. 6. - Conclusions The first Venus flyby by Solar Orbiter has delivered new insights into the large-scale structure of the induced Venusian magnetotail and magnetosheath, as well as the dynamical processes occurring within them. This flyby, along with the first Venus-flyby by BepiColombo, has allowed for the investigation of regions of Venus’s magnetotail that have never been visited before. These unique data give insight in the extendedness of induced magnetosphere around and downstream of the planet. The tail region downstream of the planet was shown to be rather active, with evidence of structures such as flux-ropes and reconnection sites, as well as cyclotron wave activity at smaller scales, close to the proton gyro radius. Interestingly, while a quasi-perpendicular bow shock is present, there is no enhanced mirror mode activity just downstream of the structure. Instead, we find evidence of strong wave activity at the local proton gyro frequency that is consistent with Doppler-shifted IC waves as well as evidence for fast-mode or magnetosonic waves. We interpret this Doppler-shift as arising from the accelerated plasma flow in the magnetosheath. Mirror mode or magnetic hole structures may instead have been identified far downstream of the shock. Upstream of the bow shock, in the solar wind, there is only little evidence of expected proton cyclotron waves. Fortunately, there are several more Venus flybys by Solar Orbiter to come, which will allow us investigate the tail further. The next one will be on 9 August 2021, immediately followed by BepiColombo’s flyby on 10 August. Here, the synergy of both spacecraft being near Venus at the same time can be used, such that one can act as a solar wind monitor whist the other is passing through the induced magnetosphere. Figure shows the orbits of both spacecraft, for the Venus 1 and 2 flybys in cylindrical coordinates. Solar Orbiter has a similar orbit, whereas BepiColombo enters more deeply into the sub-solar magnetosphere. In further flybys of Venus by Solar Orbiter, the spacecraft will move much closer to the planet, also arriving at the planet from different directions. Unfortunately, this flyby was hampered by the lack of the Solar Wind Analyser ( SWA ) data, which would have provided high-resolution ion and electron distributions. These data would have helped, for instance, in establishingthe magnetosheath plasma flow velocity and the proton temperature anisotropies, which can be determined from the velocity distribution functions. This first Venus flyby has already shown that there is still plenty to investigate and to understand about the induced magnetosphere of Venus.

A total of 26 events were found during which an Earth-like growth phase was followed by clear near-tail expansion phase signatures.
During the growth phase, just as at Earth, the thinning of the plasma sheet and the increase of the magnetic Ô¨Åeld intensity in the lobe are observed, but the fractional increase in Ô¨Åeld intensity could be ‚àº3 to 5 times that at Earth.
The average timescale of the growth phase is ‚àº1 min.
The dipolarization that marks the initiation of the substorm expansion phase is only a few seconds in duration.
During the expansion phase, lasting ‚àº1 min, the plasma sheet is observed to thicken and engulf the spacecraft.
The duration of the substorm observed in this paper is consistent with previous observations of Mercury‚Äôs Dungey cycle.
The reconÔ¨Åguration of the magnetotail during Mercury‚Äôs substorm is very similar to that at Earth despite its very compressed timescale.

Introduction The observations from Mariner 10 in 1974 revealed that Mercury has an intrinsic magnetic Ô¨Åeld and a dynamic interaction with the solar wind [Ness et al., 1974; Russell et al., 1988; Slavin et al., 2007].
Recent observations from MErcury Surface, Space ENviroment, GEochemistry, and Ranging (MESSENGER) [Solomon et al., 2007] have conÔ¨Årmed the previous results and broadened our understandings of the Mercury‚Äôs magnetosphere [e.g., Anderson et al., 2008; Slavin et al., 2009; Benna et al., 2010].
The planet‚Äôs internal magnetic Ô¨Åeld has the which is ‚àº1% of the terressame polarity as Earth‚Äôs Ô¨Åeld, but with a dipole moment of 195 to 215 nT ‚ãÖ R‚àí3 M trial, where RM ‚âà 2440 km is Mercury‚Äôs radius.
The dipole is aligned to within 5‚àò of the spin axis of the planet, but it is oÔ¨Äset to the north by ‚àº0.2 RM [Alexeev et al., 2008; Anderson et al., 2010].
At Mercury, the magnetosheath often develops a thick plasma depletion layer with low plasma ùõΩ (the ratio of plasma pressure to magnetic pressure) adjacent to the dayside magnetopause [Gershman et al., 2013].
As a result, reconnection at the Mercury‚Äôs magnetopause occurs even for small shear angles (the rotation of magnetic Ô¨Åeld from the magnetosheath into the magnetosphere) [DiBraccio et al., 2013; Slavin et al., 2014], while more than 90‚àò of shear is usually required at Earth [e.g., Sonnerup, 1974; Pu et al., 2005].
Overall, the dimensionless reconnection rate at Mercury is estimated to be ‚àº3 times larger than that at Earth [Slavin et al., 2009; DiBraccio et al., 2013].

Reconnection at the dayside magnetopause transports plasma, magnetic Ô¨Çux, and energy to the nightside magnetotail.
Reconnection occurring in the magnetotail then drives the convection of plasma, magnetic Ô¨Çux, and energy back to the dayside magnetosphere.
This circulation is called the ‚ÄúDungey cycle‚Äù [Dungey, 1961].
The duration of substorms at Earth has been shown to be of the order of the Dungey cycle time.
At Earth, it is SUN ET AL: SUBSTORM AT MERCURY 3692 Geophysical Research Letters 10.1002/2015GL064052 ‚àº1 to 3 h [e.g., Akasofu, 1964; Baker et al., 1996; Huang, 2002] and ‚àº2 to 3 min at Mercury [Siscoe et al., 1975; Slavin et al., 2010].

The black line is the mean magnetopause location according to Winslow et al.
[2013], and the circle represents the Mercury‚Äôs surface.
The trajectory of MESSENGER during three orbits is plotted in the solar wind aberrated Mercury solar magnetospheric (MSM‚Äô) X ‚Ä≤ -Z ‚Ä≤ plane, which is aberrated by Mercury‚Äôs orbital velocity so that the solar wind would radially outward from the Sun.
The trajectories are given by the colored lines, red for 1 July 2011, green for 18 June 2012, and blue for 9 December 2012.
The thick parts in each orbit represent the MESSENGER‚Äôs locations during expansion phase.
Possible dipolarizations accompanied by energetic electrons (>35 keV) were observed from the Ô¨Çyby of Mariner 10 [Baker et al., 1986; Eraker and Simpson, 1986; Christon, 1987].
Recently, MESSENGER has identiÔ¨Åed dipolarization fronts in the Mercury‚Äôs plasma sheet and provided strong evidence of spatially constrained Ô¨Çow channels [Sundberg et al., 2012].
In this work, we report the Ô¨Årst observations of Earth-like magnetospheric substorm activity including magnetic Ô¨Çux loading-unloading, plasma sheet thinning-thickening, and near-tail dipolarization events.
We also estimate the magnetic energy dissipated during substorms at Mercury.
The results show that the reconÔ¨Åguration of the magnetotail during the substorms at Mercury is remarkably similar to what is seen at Earth, albeit they occur on a timescale at a few minutes as opposed to ‚àº1‚Äì2 h.

Observations 2.1.
Overview of MESSENGER Observations The magnetic Ô¨Åeld data (20 samples per second) from the MESSENGER magnetometer [Anderson et al., 2007] and plasma data (<13 keV/q) from the Fast Imaging Plasma Spectrometer (FIPS) sensor (8 s energy scan) [Andrews et al., 2007] are used for this investigation.
The magnetic Ô¨Åeld is given in Mercury solar magnetospheric (MSM) coordinates.
In this system, XMSM and YMSM are in Mercury‚Äôs magnetic equatorial plane with XMSM directed sunward.
ZMSM is normal to the magnetic equatorial plane and points toward the north celestial pole.
YMSM completes the right-handed coordinate system.
The magnetic equatorial plane is shifted ‚àº 0.2RM northward from the equatorial plane.
MESSENGER inserted into orbit about Mercury on 18 March 2011 and entered a highly inclined (‚àº82.5‚àò ) and eccentric (‚àº 200 √ó 15 000 km) orbit.
On 16 April 2012, the apoapsis of the spacecraft was decreased and the orbital period reduced from ‚àº12 to ‚àº8 h.
We describe the MESSENGER orbits as taking place during ‚Äúhot seasons‚Äù or ‚Äúwarm seasons‚Äù according to whether periapsis was on the dayside or nightside of the planet.
During the warm seasons, MESSENGER moves southward and tailward after its periapsis on the nightside at ‚àº 60‚àò north magnetic latitude, and it crosses the plasma sheet closer to Mercury than during the hot seasons.
MESSENGER passes through the plasma sheet at a distance of ‚àº2 to 3RM during the hot seasons, which is near the location where reconnection X-line forms.
Many researches have identiÔ¨Åed the Ô¨Çux ropes or plasmoids during the hot season crossings [Slavin et al., 2009, 2010, 2012; DiBraccio et al., 2015].
Therefore, we have examined the plasma sheet passes during warm seasons to identify the magnetospheric substorm activity in the near-tail region.
Three MESSENGER warm season plasma sheet passes on 1 July 2011, 18 June 2012, and 9 December 2012 with clear substorm growth and expansion phase signatures are presented in the next section.
The locations where these near-tail passes took place are displayed in Figure 1.
The pass on 1 July 2011 (in red) is the nearest to the surface of Mercury, and we call this event as ‚ÄúEvent I.‚Äù The pass on 9 December 2012 (in blue, called ‚ÄúEvent III‚Äù) is the farthest from the planet, and the one on 18 June 2012 (in green, called ‚ÄúEvent II‚Äù) was intermediate in SUN ET AL.

altitude.
The magnetic local time of the events are ‚àº00:08, ‚àº23:37, and ‚àº00:02, respectively, indicating that all events were located very close to midnight.
2.2.
Case Studies The plasma and magnetic Ô¨Åeld measurements from the three events are displayed in Figure 2.
The Ô¨Årst and second rows are the proton E‚àïq spectra and the observed proton densities from FIPS [Raines et al., 2013].
Magnetic Ô¨Åeld observations for each case are shown as black lines from the third to seventh rows.
And Ô¨Åeld observations from the nearest nonsubstorm plasma sheet passes (i.e., with unperturbed magnetic Ô¨Åeld observation) are shown by the red dashed lines for comparison.
Vertical dashed lines mark the onset of the substorm growth phase, expansion phase, and recovery phase, respectively, from the left to right for each event.
Before the Ô¨Årst vertical dashed line the magnetic Ô¨Åeld Bx is nearly the same as the nonsubstorm pass in each case.
The diÔ¨Äerences in Bz indicate the diÔ¨Äerent conditions of the plasma sheet between the passes.
The presence of high-energy (>1 keV) protons (Ô¨Årst row) indicate that MESSENGER had entered the plasma sheet before the start of the growth phase for Event I and Event II.
The magnetic latitudes were high (>13.40‚àò for Event I and >17.50‚àò for Event II) and altitudes were low (< 460 km for Event I and < 684 km for Event II) for the two events; therefore, MESSENGER was expected to be in the high-latitude plasma sheet at that time.
No plasma was observed during Event III implying that MESSENGER was in the lobe region when the growth phase began.
A clear Bx discrepancy between the black and red dashed lines emerges beginning at the Ô¨Årst vertical dashed lines for all the events.
After periapsis, MESSENGER moves toward the equatorial plane, and the Bx measurements are expected to decrease as the red dashed lines (nonsubstorm plasma sheet passes), due to the decrease in Bdipole with decreasing magnetic latitude and the diamagnetic eÔ¨Äect of the plasma sheet.
But instead of decreasing, Bx is almost constant or slightly increases and Bz decreases for these events until the SUN ET AL.
SUN ET AL: SUBSTORM AT MERCURY 3694 Geophysical Research Letters 10.1002/2015GL064052 time marked by the second set of vertical lines.
The magnetic elevation angles (ùúÉ ), shown in the seventh row, are decreasing during this interval for all events, which imply that the magnetic Ô¨Åeld lines are stretched down the tail.
Plasma observations for Event I show that MESSENGER is still in the plasma sheet during this time.
But in Event II, the plasma spectrum implies that MESSENGER entered the lobe region at ‚àº15:35:45 in the growth phase.
Together with previous conclusion that Ô¨Åeld lines are stretched and higher altitude of MESSENGER in Event II than Event I, this location change of spacecraft from plasma sheet to lobe indicates a thinning process of the plasma sheet (recession of the outer edge of high-latitude plasma sheet).
The almost constant Bt , which is expected to decrease due to the motion of MESSENGER, during the growth phase indicates the increase of magnetic Ô¨Çux in the magnetotail.
Therefore, we conclude that this interval (between the Ô¨Årst two vertical dashed lines) is the Ô¨Çux loading process of the tail (i.e., the substorm growth phase) [e.g., Baker et al., 1996].
The plasma spectrum in Event III indicates that MESSENGER was still in the lobe during the growth phase and small increase of By implying the Ô¨Çare of magnetotail in the XY plane is also consistent with Ô¨Çux loading conclusion.
The growth phase lasted ‚àº58 s, ‚àº1 min 2 s, and ‚àº1 min 35 s for Event I, Event II, and Event III, respectively, which are consistent with previous results [Slavin et al., 2010].
Bx at the end of growth phase for the three events are ‚àº 80%, ‚àº 50%, and ‚àº 30% larger than that of nonsubstorm observations, while previous observations showed that the increase of magnetic Ô¨Åeld is only ‚àº 20 ‚àí 30% at Earth [Huang, 2002; Milan et al., 2004].This indicates that tail magnetic Ô¨Çux loaded during substorm growth phase at Mercury could be several times larger than that at Earth [see also Slavin et al., 2010].
The growth phase ended with a clear dipolarization event (the second vertical line) indicated by a sharp increase of Bz , a decrease of Bx , and Ô¨Çuctuations in By .
Bz increased by ‚àº28 nT in ‚àº6 s for Event I, ‚àº10 nT in ‚àº8 s for Event II, and ‚àº8 nT in ‚àº5 s for Event III, individually.
Bx for all events sharply decreased to below the red dashed lines in ‚àº40 s, which is the signature of rapid plasma sheet thickening.
It is worth to note that other possible dipolarizations are observed in Event II and Event III, which should be the signatures for multiplanetward plasma Ô¨Çows.
The end of the plasma sheet thickening is approximately identiÔ¨Åed as the intersection point between the observed Bx and nonsubstorm Bx , which is marked by the third vertical dashed lines.
These regions coincide with high Bz and also Ô¨Çuctuations of By (the signature of Ô¨Åeld-aligned currents (FACs)) which are also consistent with the signatures of substorm expansion phase at Earth [e.g., Rostoker et al., 1980].
In the plasma observation of Event I, we Ô¨Ånd that the plasma has higher energy after dipolarization than the plasma before dipolarization implying an acceleration process during dipolarization.
Especially immediately after the dipolarization, only a few proton (‚àº0.03 cm‚àí3 ) with energy higher than ‚àº 8 keV was detected indicating that the amount of proton was accelerated to higher-energy range out of the scope of FIPS.
The emergence of >1 keV protons in Event II and Event III suggests that MESSENGER entered the plasma sheet in both cases during the expansion phase, which might further conÔ¨Årm the abruptly thickening of Mercury‚Äôs plasma sheet after dipolarization because MESSENGER moved only tens of kilometers in this time.
This is similar to the Earth‚Äôs plasma sheet evolution during substorm.
2.3.
Statistical Results The three cases presented in the previous section reveal that a clear substorm at Mercury includes plasma sheet thinning (growth phase), dipolarization, and plasma sheet thickening (expansion phase).
According to the changes of MESSENGER‚Äôs location, we can categorize the events into three types based on the plasma measurements.
Type I is represented by Event I that spacecraft was always located in the plasma sheet during the substorm.
Type II is deÔ¨Åned as spacecraft moved from plasma sheet into the lobe region during the growth phase and reentered the plasma sheet after dipolarization due to the thickening of plasma sheet as observed in Event II.
Spacecraft in Type III was located in the lobe region before and during the growth phase and entered the plasma sheet after dipolarization as Event III.
A statistical study is performed to investigate the three types of events.
As mentioned above, we have surveyed all the warm season orbits of MESSENGER from 20:11 - 20:14 to look for the events related with magnetospheric substorm activity; i.e., spacecraft observed an almost constant Bt and Bx at Ô¨Årst which is ended with a dipolarization event and followed by sharp decrease in Bx , high Bz , and Ô¨Çuctuation in By .
The selection resulted in 26 events.
The time duration of growth phase and expansion phase is determined from the comparison with the nonsubstorm plasma sheet observations.
The position distributions of the 26 events are displayed in MSM‚Äô X ‚Ä≤ -Z ‚Ä≤ (Figure 3a) and X ‚Ä≤ -Y ‚Ä≤ (Figure 3b) planes.
Type I, II, and III events are denoted by the red, green, and blue dots, respectively.
We can see that Type I events are in lower altitude and lower latitude regions than the other two types of events.
Type III events are located further tailward and northward, and Type II events are generally distributed between these two groups.
This distribution of the three types of events is consistent with the evolution of shape of the plasma SUN ET AL.

sheet during the substorm.
The plasma sheet thinning during growth phase would let the events near plasma sheet boundary (Type II) move into the lobe and reenter the plasma sheet in expansion phase.
Figures 3c and 3d show the histograms of growth phase and expansion phase durations for all the events.
The average duration for the growth phase is ‚àº 65 s and is ‚àº 60 s for the expansion phase.
The results are consistent with previously found loading-unloading time (‚àº 2‚Äì3 min) [Slavin et al., 2010].
2.4.
Estimation of Dissipated Energy In this section, we take the three cases in section 2.2 to estimate the total dissipated magnetic energy during Mercury‚Äôs substorm, which is assumed to be the diÔ¨Äerence between the magnetic energy at the end of growth phase and expansion phase.
We take Event I as an example.
Bt was ‚àº122 nT at the end of growth phase for this case.
This is consistent with the predicted value (‚àº120 nT) from power law equation determined from MESSENGER‚Äôs third Ô¨Çyby of Mercury when a series of loading-unloading events were observed: ‚Ä≤ Bt (X) = 122.9|XMSM |‚àí1.6 + 28.9, ‚Ä≤ where XMSM is in RM and Bt is in nT [Slavin et al., 2012].
From this equation, Bt was estimated to be ‚àº70 nT at ‚àº 2RM , which is the assumed location for near-Mercury neutral line (NMNL) [Slavin et al., 2012; DiBraccio et al., 2015].
The cross-tail radius of Mercury‚Äôs magnetosphere between the planet and the NMNL is estimated from the Shue magnetopause model: ( )ùõº 2 R = Rss , 1 + cos ùúÉ where ùúÉ is the angle between R and the Mercury‚Äôs dipole-Sun line, Rss is the subsolar standoÔ¨Ä distance, and ùõº is the Ô¨Çaring parameter [Shue et al., 1998; Winslow et al., 2013].
The best Ô¨Åtting parameters for this case are Rss = 1.25RM and ùõº = 0.65 based on the pressure balance between the solar wind and magnetosphere in the magnetopause.
Solar wind condition is assumed to be the averaged values: PSW ‚àº15 nPa [Winslow SUN ET AL.

Red, green, and blue dots represent the Event I, Event II, and Event III in Figure 2.
et al., 2013].
Therefore, the magnetic energy stored in the magnetotail between the NMNL and the planet can be estimated from ‚àí1RM EB = ‚à´‚àí2RM ùúãr2 (X)B2t (X)‚àï2ùúá0 dX, ‚Ä≤ .
The estimated total magnetic energy stored r(X) is the radius for the circular of magnetopause at speciÔ¨Åc XMSM in the Mercury‚Äôs magnetotail at the end of growth phase is ‚àº1.67 √ó 1012 J.
At the end of expansion phase, Bt is ‚àº55 nT and the total energy is ‚àº 7.6 √ó 1011 J.
Therefore, the magnetic energy dissipated during the expansion phase is ‚àº 9.1√ó1011 J for Event I.
Employing the similar processes as above, our estimate of the total dissipated magnetic energy in Event II is ‚àº 6.7 √ó 1011 J and ‚àº 8.1 √ó 1011 J for Event III.
Previous studies have shown that the typical energy loaded during a substorm at Earth is ‚àº 2.1 √ó 1015 J [e.g., Akasofu, 1981; Tanskanen et al., 2002], which is ‚àº 3000 times larger than that at Mercury.
Tanskanen et al.
[2002] showed that ‚àº 30% of the magnetic energy loaded into the Earth‚Äôs tail was dissipated in the Northern Hemisphere via Joule heating.
Let us assume that the same amount of magnetic energy was dissipated in each hemisphere during Mercury‚Äôs substorm.
Then the dissipated magnetic energy (Ed ) in each hemisphere would be ‚àº2.7 √ó 1011 J, ‚àº2 √ó 1011 J, and ‚àº2.4 √ó 1011 J for Event I, Event II, and Event III, respectively.
Recent study revealed that the net electrical conductance (ùúç ) for the closure of steady state FACs is ‚àº 1 S [Anderson et al., 2014].
And our result shows that the time duration (TEX ) of substorm expansion phase is ‚àº 60 s.
The magnitude of FACs during Mercury‚Äôs substorm expansion phase could be simply deduced from 2 TEX ‚àïùúç = Ed .
We get IFAC ‚àº 67, ‚àº 58, and ‚àº 63 kA for the three events, respectively.
These values durthe IFAC ing substorms are consistent with the conclusion of Anderson et al.
[2014]; i.e., the magnitude of steady state FACs in the northern hemisphere of Mercury is commonly ‚àº 20‚Äì40 kA and could exceed 200 kA during disturbed condition.
We want to note that Event I was observed in the plasma sheet so that the lobe magnetic Ô¨Åeld should be larger than the values.
And therefore, the real energy dissipation during the expansion phase in this event was underestimated in some extent.

Summary In this paper, we have investigated substorm processes in Mercury‚Äôs magnetotail using magnetic Ô¨Åeld and plasma observations from MESSENGER.
We, for the Ô¨Årst time, have reported observations of substorm growth and expansion phases in such a detail, measured their properties, and estimated the total magnetic energy dissipated during substorms at Mercury.
Case studies and statistical analyses have revealed that the global reconÔ¨Åguration of the magnetotail during Mercury‚Äôs substorms is similar to that at Earth [e.g., McPherron et al., 1973; Baker et al., 1996].
The evolution of Mercury‚Äôs near-tail magnetic Ô¨Åeld during a substorm is shown schematically in Figure 4 relative to the positions of the three events analyzed in section 2.2.
MESSENGER was inside the plasma sheet for Event I (red dot) and Event II (green dot) at the beginning of the growth SUN ET AL.
SUN ET AL: SUBSTORM AT MERCURY 3697 Geophysical Research Letters 10.1002/2015GL064052 phase (Figure 4a).
After the growth phase, MESSENGER in Event II was moved from plasma sheet into the lobe due to the thinning of plasma sheet (Figure 4b).
During the growth phase, dayside magnetopause would be moved planetward due to the erosion caused by magnetic reconnection [e.g., Slavin and Holzer, 1979].
The magnetic Ô¨Åeld lines in the magnetotail were compressed, and magnetic reconnection at the near-Mercury ‚Ä≤ reconnection site (XMSM ‚àº ‚àí2.2RM ) then drives plasma Ô¨Çow planetward.
After plasma Ô¨Çow encounters the strong magnetic Ô¨Åeld, a few second duration dipolarization leading the thickening of plasma sheet could be triggered.
And MESSENGER during Events II and III would enter the plasma sheet during the expansion phase as shown in Figure 4c.
The reconÔ¨Åguration of the magnetotail during a substorm at Mercury is similar to what happens at Earth.
The durations of the growth and expansion phases at Mercury are ‚àº65 s and ‚àº60 s, while the duration of the growth phase is ‚àº1 h and the expansion phase is ‚àº30 min for Earth‚Äôs substorm [e.g., Akasofu, 1964; Huang, 2002].
Our estimation of dissipated magnetic energy during Mercury‚Äôs substorm is 3 orders smaller than at Earth.
And the total FACs during substorm is ‚àº60 kA which is 2 orders of magnitude lower than at Earth.
